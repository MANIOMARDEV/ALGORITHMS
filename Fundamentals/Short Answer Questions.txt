Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program written in a programming language. It contains instructions that a computer can understand and execute.

Computers are considered "smart" because they can process vast amounts of data quickly, perform complex calculations, and execute tasks based on programmed instructions.

The purpose of a programming language is to provide a set of rules and syntax for writing source code to create software applications or perform specific tasks on a computer.

Three examples of programming languages are Python, JavaScript, and C++. There are many programming languages because different languages are designed for specific purposes, offer different levels of abstraction, and have unique features and strengths.

A variable is a named storage location in a computer's memory that holds data. Variables are useful because they allow programmers to store and manipulate data dynamically within a program.

In most programming languages, a single-equals (=) is used for assignment, while a double-equals (==) is used for comparison. The single-equals assigns a value to a variable, whereas the double-equals compares two values for equality.

In JavaScript, a double-equals (==) checks for loose equality, meaning it performs type coercion before comparing values. A triple-equals (===) checks for strict equality, meaning it does not perform type coercion and requires both the value and the type to be the same for two values to be considered equal.

The developer console exists primarily for debugging purposes. It allows developers to inspect and interact with the runtime environment of a web page or application, view error messages, and execute JavaScript code.

Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions and execute different code based on whether a condition is true or false. An example is an "if" statement that checks if a variable is greater than a certain value and executes a block of code if the condition is true.

FOR and WHILE loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. We use them in source code to automate repetitive tasks or iterate over collections of data.

You would use a WHILE loop when you need to repeat a block of code based on a condition that may change during the loop's execution. In contrast, a FOR loop is typically used when you know the exact number of iterations needed.

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. We use functions to modularize code, improve code readability, and promote code reuse.

A function can return one value, but it can also return multiple values by packaging them into a data structure like an array or an object. When calling a function, you can send in as many values as its parameters require.

An array is a data structure that can hold multiple values of the same data type. It allows us to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.

A T-diagram, also known as a trace table, is a method used to track the values of variables as a program executes. It helps programmers understand how variables change over time and debug code more effectively.

The two ways to comment JavaScript code are single-line comments, denoted by //, and multi-line comments, enclosed between /* and */. Single-line comments are typically used for short comments on a single line, while multi-line comments are used for longer explanations or commenting out multiple lines of code.
